Modern capitalism is undergoing radical changes due to new social trends and blockchain development. We are living in the Post-Fordism era, where the labor is not alienated anymore, capital isn't fixed and means of production aren't necessarily owned by the bourgeoisie. So let Karl Marx rest in peace while our generation rethinking not only the Labor conditions and organization structures but the Labor itself.

We #BUIDL KYODO new economy model for DAO with the hottest instrument of rewarding community participants.
KYODO Dapp is for managing DAO based on Ethereum blockchain.

Many modern thinkers have noted new features of the Post labor era that we are experiencing nowadays.
The main long-term social trends should be taken into account modeling modern organization.

### Main long-term social and economic trends
- Liquid modernity / Hyper fluidity / Constant changing / Avoiding long-term obligations / Nomadism <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>
- Third industrial revolution / Global switching from vertical hierarchy to horizontal organizations / Decentralization <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>
- Post labor <sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup> / Workless world <sup id="a4">[4](#f4)</sup>  / Labor Gamification <sup id="a5">[5](#f5)</sup> 
- Networks for collective individuation <sup id="a6">[6](#f6)</sup>

"It is a kind of chaotic continuation of modernity, where a person can shift from one social position to another in a fluid manner. Nomadism becomes a general trait of the 'liquid modern' man as he flows through his own life like a tourist, changing places, jobs, spouses, values and sometimes more—such as political or sexual orientation—excluding himself from traditional networks of support, while also freeing himself from the restrictions or requirements those networks impose."

"Jeremy Rifkin explores how Internet technology and renewable energy are merging to create a powerful new engine of economic growth. This process will usher in a fundamental reordering of human relationships, from hierarchical to lateral, that will impact the way we conduct commerce, govern society, educate our children, and engage in civic life."

"Labor becomes a voluntary activity there the working class owns the means of production. With this freedom, humans create with sincerity and desire, and not out of materialistic necessity."

“New revolution is moving us to the edge of workless world”
“the information and communication technology revolutions virtually guarantee more production with less human labor… Free time will come, William Green said, the only choice is unemployment or leisure.”

<b id="f5">5</b> 
"According to Marx, capitalist is "alienated" labor. However, the situation is different now. As capitalism grew to become semiotic, aesthetic and play-like, the structure of human desire changed. Since the 1990s, wages have not been the only incentive for economic activity. That is, there has been an increasing amount of people who pursue what they are good at, even at the expense of high wages."
"Play and labor" Chin Jungkwon 2017 "Superhumanity" [↩](#a5)

The era of self-interested individuals, but they are looking for individuation through collective, through common activity and they will need networks for individuation.

"Each collective project could be defined by an agreed-upon goal, and requirements of fulfillment are collective initiated and updated by ‘members’ of the group.
Tasks can then be assigned either in the form of individual actions or subgroups. Groups can be merged together to form larger projects at any time, and a project can also be split into smaller collectives. 
In this manner, collectives can discover each other and communicate to seek possibilities of collaborations and information sharing.”

## Working process / Org structure
Today in nanosecond era the effective functioning of organization requires quicker responses and faster decision making to remain competitive. The traditional control and coordination functions are dreadfully slow and incapable of responding in real time. The modern companies are reconstructing themselves, eliminating hierarchy and middle management. The cutting edge org structure has features of  Adhocracy and cooperatives (crypto co-ops). 

"Adhocracy is a complex and dynamic organizational form. 
It is characterized by an adaptive, creative and flexible integrative behavior based on non-permanence and spontaneity. It is believed that these characteristics allow adhocracy to respond faster than traditional bureaucratic organizations while being more open to new ideas."  Wikipedia

"Cooperatives differ from traditional companies in that they are typically funded by direct member investment, rather than investment from third-party shareholders. This allows members to decide on the values of the enterprise, which don’t necessarily need to be about the maximization of profits. In fact, cooperatives tend to be most successful where there’s alignment on other values such as 1) a communal benefit to pooling resources, for economies of scale; and 2) an attendant desire to avoid anti-competitive or extractive behavior." Jesse Walden https://a16z.com/2019/03/02/cooperatives-cryptonetworks/

Example:
Before
A startup gets funding and hires specialists for work.
Now 
The like-minded group of people develops a product, emerging the self-motivated new participants, getting funding or being sustainable.

Kyodo is the tool of management for such organizations as DAO and crypto co-ops.

The liquid character of society dictates the way people communicate with each other. The irrelevance of permanent working place provoked the rise of coworking platforms such as Riot, Github, Jitsy, etc. KYODO develops the layer that connects those platforms to blockchain by bringing there instant payment system - Impression revenue model (Check payment paragraph). 


### The scope of usage
Basically, any Motley crew can use KYODO as a glue.
All kind of DAO can run their community on the KYODO platform. KYODO can cover fields:
- Sturt ups
- Local development (economic  and political)
- Charity
- Activism

KYODO's main ambitions are:
- high activity of members;
- self-motivation and self-responsibility of members;
- hyper-flexibility to handle high liquidity of members and tasks;
- trusted governance;
- stable currency to reward contributors;
- effective fund management;
- good UX to eliminate the entry barrier for newcomers;
- ability to scale.

### KYODO features
* Create a working DAO group. KYODO provides a clear interface for manage processes, gives a constructor to build a customized version of a DAO for the wide range of spheres.
* Ability to mint your own token or use existing mintable one. Based on Colony.
* Instant tipping tool - instant payment for a contribution in crypto via different working chats. DF balance is reflected on the KYODO interface, and kept on Ethereum blockchain.
* Token economy with inflation as an incentive system.
* Democratic voting on the blockchain. Based on Aragon.
* Multi-signature wallet holding fund treasury.
* Task management interface.
* Network effect incorporated.

### Domains
All the activities of DAOs could be  divided within domains, that reflect it's specifics. 
For example Decent.Fund has 4 domains:
* DEV domain (UI/UX design, programming, digital marketing)
* SOCIAL domain (research, articles, infographics, meetups, hackathons, social activity)
* FUND management domain (smart investment, crypto asset management)
* GOV domain (strategy)

The domain concept KYODO takes from Colony. 
"Domain is like a folder in a shared filesystem, except instead of containing files and folders, it can contain sub-domains and tasks . This simple modularity enables great flexibility as to how an organization may be structured.

It is ultimately up to individual colonies to decide how they wish to use domains — some might only use them for coarse categorizations, whereas others may use them to precise group only the most similar tasks together, or even multiple tasks that other colonies would consider a single task."  [Whitepapper Colony](https://colony.io/whitepaper.pdf)

The domains structure is also fluid. The community member can initiate the new domain if they feel they found a new activity's dimension that doesn't fit previous domains. Easy migration and changing roles also work for better individualization process of members, KYODO inspires self-defining and empowers the enthusiasm.




### Transaction costs
The KYODO framework uses Blockchain, tokenization and collective intelligence to lower the costs of coordination DAOs and allow it to scale larger.

1. Costs of blockchain transactions: KYODO records to Ethereum blockchain the token allocation. To reduce the transaction cost of this operation. KYODO doesn't record every tip that each member receives, but collect the data of it on backend application with Mongo database cache layer. KYODO records the data to the Ethereum blockchain one time in the end of period paying ETH for Gas. Period* - conditional time interval while tips are collecting before being recalculated into tokens and sent to a members.

2. Bargaining costs: They are the costs related to coming to an agreement that is agreeable to the parties involved and drawing up the contract. Aragon voting permissionless system

3. Policing and enforcement costs: They are the costs associated with making sure that the parties in the contract keep their word and do not default on the terms of the contract.

4. Search and information costs: They are the costs associated with looking for relevant information and meeting with agents with whom the transaction will take place. KYODO motivates to share result to be rewarded.

5. Opportunistic behavior: KYODO impression based reward model

## Token model
KYODO implements continuous token model.

Purpose: Cryptocurrency.

The DF token serves as payment for tasks and as the medium of exchange. The DF token is tied to the fund of the community.

```
DF token price = Total cap / Circulating supply
```

DF token also is a Network token that gives:
- Ability to fund task
- Ability to valuate member contribution
- Ability to initiate a dispute

Underlying value: The value generated by the Decent.Fund increases the DF token value and wealth of every member in a community.

Utility: DF token is the hybrid token that has traits of both Usage and Work tokens:
- Grants access to system functionalities
- Allows holder to contribute to the system
- Legal status: Utility token, closely tied to functionality. Grants holders ability to contribute to the system vs. passive investor role.

Tech layer: Ethereum ERC20 Mintable token.

How to obtain DF token: buy in the FUND domain or on a decentralized exchange, and earn by completing tasks in domains of Decent.Fund.

## Incentives
Incentives involve both monetary and non-monetary rewards and punishments, including the pay-for-performance reward systems (Impression revenue model) and Inflation:

Impression revenue model — DF tokens received for appreciated contribution to the community;
Holder value —DF token value increases throughout time due to increase of assets holding by the fund;
Inactivity punishment — Passive members’ share is decreasing due to inflation.

### Inflation as incentive tool
> Now that the commodity value of human labor is becoming increasingly tangential in an even more automated world, new ways of defining human worth and the social relationship will need to be explored
>
> -- *Jeremy Rifkin* "End of work"

KYODO explores new ways to reward and incentivize community members. KYODO is the new tool for liquid labor because the "Pay per hour" rewarding model is now better fitted for machines than humans.

A horizontal organization is free from the management layer leaving its stakeholders in full self-responsibility for the outcome. However, any rational participant is interested in further development and flourish of the organization. Thus, novel management model should be aimed to unite and guide productive members to collective benefit.

In an organization run by KYODO, stakeholders are bounded by the token which represents ownership of all common assets and rights for future revenue distribution. The model suggests simple mechanics as an incentive for members to stay active and productive contributors: minting new tokens through activity.

#### In practice
At the start of a period (usually not less than a month), every member of DAO receives a stack of points based on their native token holdings. Those points are used to reward other members of DAO who make valuable contributions (Impression based model). After period ends, new native tokens are minted and distributed among members pro rata to earned points.

The quantity of newly minted tokens(inflation) is derived from the overall level of activity in DAO by the following principle: the lower the activity, the higher the inflation would be and vice versa. Activity is determined through simple relation: Ps/Pt, where Ps - total points spent by all members during a period; Pt - total points at the start of a period. Inflation rate and activity relation graph

Such interrelation provides a strong incentive to contribute right at the start of a period as initial contributions will have huge weight (for some time at least). As a period goes by, less active members will try to spend all their points lowering inflation or try to earn points by themselves. Totally passive members will eventually feel the pressure of inflation and either leave the DAO or start to deliver useful contributions.

As we can see, inflation could serve both as a reward for active contributors and as soft non-human moderator for inactive members. However, there are concerns and opened questions around this model. For instance, how early contributor currently inactive will behave? Is quitting a good option for such member or it will be more beneficial to have their stake cut by inflation, but stay in DAO until stable revenue develops? How "fair" those rewards would be from the rewarded member point of view? How initial capital will be formed?
How DAOs will regulate entry and exit of new members?
